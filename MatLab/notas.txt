x = 5 ; size(x) 	: 1 1  -> a 1 by 1 matrix

; 			after a line to suppress the output

' 			-> transpose matrix

; 			while defining a matrix, to define lines

M = matrix

x = 0:10 		creates a matrix with one line, and ints from 0 to 10

M(row,:)  ; 		: calls all columns of [row]
M(:;column)   ; 	: calls all rows of [column]

M(2:3, 2:3)   ; 	returns the second and third row, and the second at the second and third column

M.*A   ; 		Multiplies each value in M by the corresponding value on A, M(1,1) * A(1,1)
M./A

x=[ 1 2 3 ]
y=[ 4 5 6 ]
x*y'    ; 		Internal product, can be done with function dot(x,y)

x'*y	; 		Outer product, no function available

cross(x,y)    ; 	cross multiplication

sin , cos , tan
exp    ; 		exponential
log
sqrt
			if pi is used as variable, it loses its original value. How to clear: go to workspace
i
^			for exponents

zeros(rows, columns)
ones(rows, columns)

			function name has to be the same as file name

% 			for line comment

x = 0:10
function(x)		prints all return values for each value of x (0 through 10)

only use [ ] for output arguments, if more than 1 variable

~0 = 1
~1 = 0
